# raylib-snake

A snake game written in C++ with Raylib! I started this as a practice project. Works on Windows, I have not tested this on Linux/MacOS.

# Build

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fahlerile/raylib-snake.git
cd raylib-snake/build
cmake ..
./snake.exe
```

# TODO
- Add food (and score!)
- Fix buggy controls
